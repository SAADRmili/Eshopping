## üöÄ Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular, scalable, and fault-tolerant system design.
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns for maintainability and scalability.
- **Secure Communication**: Authentication and Authorization using **Azure AD** / **Identity Server 4**.
- **Efficient Messaging**: Asynchronous messaging with **RabbitMQ**.
- **High-Performance Communication**: Use of **GRPC** for inter-service communication.
- **Service Mesh Management**: Traffic control and observability with **Istio**.
- **Multi-Database Support**: Integration with **SQL Server**, **MongoDB**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Redis**.
- **Dynamic API Gateway**: Powered by **Azure API Gateway**, **Ocelot**, and **Nginx**.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Seamless local and cloud deployment with **Helm Charts** and **AKS**.
- **Advanced UI**: Fully functional **Angular 18** frontend for eCommerce applications.
